# Tasks: Pokemon Team Builder with PokeAPI Integration

**Feature**: 003-pokemon-team-builder  
**Branch**: `003-pokemon-team-builder`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-pokemon-team-builder/`  
**Prerequisites**: ✅ plan.md, ✅ spec.md, ✅ research.md, ✅ data-model.md, ✅ contracts/

**Implementation Strategy**: MVP-first approach. User Stories 1 & 4 (both P1) form the minimum viable product: browse Pokemon and start battles. User Stories 2 & 3 (P2) add move selection and team building capabilities.

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification. Focus on implementation and manual testing.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
- **[Story]**: User story label (US1, US2, US3, US4) - only for user story phase tasks
- Include exact file paths in all descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and TypeScript interface definitions

- [X] T001 Create directory structure: `src/models/teamBuilder.ts`, `src/services/teamBuilder/`, `src/components/teamBuilder/`
- [X] T002 [P] Create TypeScript models file in `src/models/teamBuilder.ts` with Pokemon, Move, TeamMember, Team interfaces per data-model.md
- [X] T003 [P] Create PokeAPI types file in `src/services/teamBuilder/types.ts` with PokeAPIResponse interfaces per contracts/

**Validation**: TypeScript compiles with no errors (`npm run type-check`) ✅

---

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Phase 2 Foundation (ALL can run in parallel)

- T004-T009: All service files independent (pokemonService, moveService, teamCache, index.ts)
- T010-T011: Team store independent of services (uses types from T002-T003)

### Phase 3 User Story 1 (some parallel)

- T012-T013: Components independent (PokemonCard, PokemonCatalog)
- T019-T021: View and routing tasks after components complete

### Phase 4 User Story 2 (some parallel)

- T022-T023: Components independent (MoveCard, MoveSelector)
- T024: Service function independent of components

### Phase 5 User Story 3 (some parallel)

- T032-T033: Components independent (TeamMemberCard, TeamRoster)

### Phase 6 User Story 4 (some parallel)

- T045: Utility function independent
- T046-T049: Battle store modifications sequential

### Phase 7 Polish (ALL can run in parallel)

- T056-T063: All polish tasks independent (caching, docs, accessibility)

**Estimated Total Time**: ~11-13 hours for full feature (MVP: ~6-7 hours)
